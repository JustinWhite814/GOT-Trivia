# Project 1

## Description
Welcome to Game Of Thrones Trivia. It's a pretty simple game really.
You have to guess the proper answer of the question. You have unlimited time,
However you cannot move until you get the answer correct. I'm nice enough to be obvious
There is some cool styling and it's completely formatted for one page ONLY. I use a lot of DOM 
Manipulation as well as different functions to constantly write over the HTML. 


## Users
-Avid Game of Thrones fans that love the books and the shows.
-All seven seasons(we don't talk about season 8)
-Hopefully just a fun game that everyone will love. I seem to enjoy it, even knowing the answers.
-Nerds who love Trivia and tv shows/books about Dragons

## Hurdles 
I would say learning even more about nested arrays and dom manipulation. I have some work to do in that area.
I did learn a lot though, This project really helped bring me closer to understanding it all.
